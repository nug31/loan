# Next Steps: Complete AWS RDS Setup

## Current Status ✅
- AWS RDS configuration files have been created
- Environment variables are set up with placeholders
- Migration and testing scripts are ready

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Create AWS RDS Instance

1. **Go to AWS Console**
   - Visit https://aws.amazon.com/
   - Sign in to your AWS account (create one if needed)

2. **Navigate to RDS Service**
   - Search for "RDS" in the AWS services
   - Click on "RDS" to open the RDS console

3. **Create Database**
   - Click "Create database"
   - Choose "Standard create"
   - Select "MySQL" as engine type
   - Choose MySQL version 8.0.x

4. **Configure Database Settings**
   - **Template**: Choose "Free tier" (for testing) or "Production"
   - **DB instance identifier**: `gudang1-production`
   - **Master username**: `admin`
   - **Master password**: Use the same password: `Reddevils94_`

5. **Instance Configuration**
   - **DB instance class**: `db.t3.micro` (free tier)
   - **Storage**: 20 GB General Purpose SSD

6. **Connectivity Settings**
   - **Public access**: Choose "Yes"
   - **VPC security group**: Create new
   - **Database port**: 3306

7. **Additional Configuration**
   - **Initial database name**: `gudang1`
   - **Enable automated backups**: Yes

8. **Create the Database**
   - Click "Create database"
   - Wait 10-20 minutes for creation

### Step 2: Get Your RDS Endpoint

After your RDS instance is created:

1. Go to RDS Console
2. Click on your database instance
3. Copy the **Endpoint** (it will look like: `gudang1-production.xxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`)

### Step 3: Update Configuration

1. **Edit the server/.env file**
   - Replace `your-rds-endpoint.xxxxxxxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com` 
   - With your actual RDS endpoint

2. **Example:**
   ```env
   DB_HOST=gudang1-production.abc123def456.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
   AWS_RDS_HOST=gudang1-production.abc123def456.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Security Group

1. **Go to EC2 Console → Security Groups**
2. **Find your RDS security group**
3. **Edit inbound rules**
4. **Add rule:**
   - Type: MySQL/Aurora
   - Port: 3306
   - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (for testing; restrict in production)

### Step 5: Test Connection

After updating the endpoint, run:
```bash
cd server
node test-aws-rds.js
```

### Step 6: Migrate Database

If the connection test passes:
```bash
cd server
node migrate-to-aws-rds.js
```

This will:
- Export your local database
- Create SQL files for import
- Provide import instructions

### Step 7: Import Data to AWS RDS

Use the generated SQL file:
```bash
mysql -h your-rds-endpoint.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p gudang1 < aws-rds-migration/complete_migration.sql
```

## Backend Deployment Options

Since you asked about Netlify for backend deployment, here are your options:

### Option 1: Netlify Functions (Serverless) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- Convert your Express.js API to Netlify Functions
- Integrated with your frontend
- Automatic scaling
- No server management

### Option 2: Traditional Hosting
- **Render**: Easy deployment, good free tier
- **Railway**: Modern platform, great DX
- **Heroku**: Established platform
- **DigitalOcean**: Reliable, good pricing

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Netlify Functions if:**
- You want everything in one place
- Your API calls are simple and fast (< 10 seconds)
- You prefer serverless architecture

**Choose Traditional Hosting if:**
- You have complex, long-running operations
- You need persistent connections
- You want to keep your current Express.js structure

## Files to Check

1. **`aws-rds-deployment-guide.md`** - Complete deployment instructions
2. **`aws-rds-checklist.md`** - Track your progress
3. **`server/.env`** - Update with your RDS endpoint
4. **`netlify-functions-guide.md`** - If you choose Netlify Functions

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the AWS RDS setup guide: `aws-rds-setup.md`
2. Review the deployment guide: `aws-rds-deployment-guide.md`
3. Use the test script to diagnose connection issues

## Cost Estimate

- **AWS RDS Free Tier**: Free for 12 months
- **Netlify**: Free tier available
- **Total**: $0/month for the first year (with free tiers)
