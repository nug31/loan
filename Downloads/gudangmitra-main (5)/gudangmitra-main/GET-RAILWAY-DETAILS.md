# Get Railway External Connection Details

## Current Issue
Your `.env` file has `mysql.railway.internal` which only works from within Railway's network, not from your local machine.

## How to Get External Details

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard
1. **Go to**: https://railway.app/
2. **Open your project**
3. **Click on your MySQL service**
4. **Look for one of these tabs**:
   - "Connect"
   - "Settings" 
   - "Variables"
   - "Networking"

### Method 2: Look for These Variables
In the Variables tab, look for:
- `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL`
- `MYSQL_PUBLIC_URL` 
- `DATABASE_URL`
- Or similar external connection strings

### Method 3: Connection String Format
Railway usually provides connection details like:
```
mysql://root:password@containers-us-west-123.railway.app:6543/railway
```

## What You Need to Find

You need these 4 pieces of information:
1. **External Host**: `containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app`
2. **External Port**: Usually `6543` or similar (NOT 3306)
3. **Username**: `root`
4. **Password**: Your actual password (you already have this)

## Update Your .env File

Once you have the external details, update `server/.env`:

```env
# Replace these lines:
DB_HOST=mysql.railway.internal
DB_PORT=3306

# With your external details:
DB_HOST=containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app
DB_PORT=6543
```

## Example of What to Look For

In Railway dashboard, you might see:
```
Connection Details:
Host: containers-us-west-123.railway.app
Port: 6543
Username: root
Password: pvOcQbzlDAobtcdozbMvCdIDDEmenwkO
Database: railway
```

## Alternative: Railway CLI

If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway login
railway connect
```

## Can't Find External Details?

If you can't find the external connection details:
1. **Check if "Public Networking" is enabled** in your MySQL service settings
2. **Look for a "Connect" or "Database" tab** in your service
3. **Try the Railway CLI** method above
4. **Contact Railway support** if needed

**Once you have the external host and port, update your .env file and let me know!**
