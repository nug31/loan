## Deployment Instructions

### Backend Deployment (Server)

1. **Set up a MySQL database**
   - Create a MySQL database named `gudang1` or use your existing database
   - Make sure the database is accessible from your hosting provider
   - For production, use a database hosting service like:
     - [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) (MySQL compatible)
     - [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/)
     - [DigitalOcean Managed MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-mysql)

2. **Deploy the backend to a hosting service**
   - Options include:
     - [Render](https://render.com/)
     - [Railway](https://railway.app/)
     - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
     - [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)

3. **Set environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your database credentials
   - Set these environment variables in your hosting provider's dashboard:
     ```
     DB_HOST=your-database-host
     DB_USER=your-database-user
     DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
     DB_NAME=gudang1
     DB_PORT=3306
     PORT=3002 (or let the provider set this)
     CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
     ```

### Frontend Deployment (Netlify)

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify**
   - Sign up for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set the build command to `npm run build`
   - Set the publish directory to `dist`

2. **Set environment variables in Netlify**
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add the environment variable:
     ```
     VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
     ```

3. **Deploy your site**
   - Trigger a deploy from the Netlify dashboard
   - Your site will be available at a Netlify subdomain (e.g., `your-app.netlify.app`)

## Local Development

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```
   npm install
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the backend server**
   ```
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3002

## Database Configuration

The application uses a MySQL database. Make sure you have MySQL installed and running locally for development, or use a remote MySQL database for production.

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (.env.local or .env.production)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3002 (for development)
