# Backend Deployment Options with Netlify

## Option 1: Netlify Functions (Serverless) - RECOMMENDED

Netlify Functions allow you to run serverless backend code. This is the best option for deploying your backend on Netlify.

### Pros:
- ✅ Integrated with your frontend deployment
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ No server management
- ✅ Built-in HTTPS
- ✅ Easy environment variable management
- ✅ Cost-effective for moderate traffic

### Cons:
- ❌ 10-second timeout limit per function
- ❌ Cold start delays
- ❌ Limited to 50MB deployment size
- ❌ Stateless (no persistent connections)

### Best For:
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Authentication
- File uploads
- Webhook handlers

## Option 2: Traditional Server Hosting

Deploy your Express.js server to dedicated hosting services.

### Recommended Services:
1. **Render** - Easy deployment, good free tier
2. **Railway** - Modern platform, great developer experience
3. **Heroku** - Established platform, easy scaling
4. **DigitalOcean App Platform** - Reliable, good pricing
5. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** - If you're already using AWS RDS

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)

Use Netlify Functions for your API while keeping your frontend on Netlify. This gives you the best of both worlds.

### Architecture:
```
Frontend (Netlify) → API Functions (Netlify Functions) → Database (AWS RDS)
```
