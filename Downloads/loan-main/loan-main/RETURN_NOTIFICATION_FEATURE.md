# Return Confirmation Notification Feature ðŸ””

## Overview
SmartLend has a built-in notification system that automatically alerts administrators when users confirm they have returned borrowed items.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **User has an active/overdue loan**
2. **User clicks "Confirm Returned" button** in My Loans section
3. **System marks loan as `returnRequested: true`**
4. **Button changes to "Return pending" status**
5. **User receives confirmation notification**

### Admin Flow  
1. **Admin receives instant notification** about return confirmation
2. **Admin can verify physical return** of the item
3. **Admin clicks "Mark Returned"** to complete the process
4. **Item quantity is restored to inventory**

## Notification Details

### For Admin
- **Title:** "User Confirmed Return"
- **Message:** "{User Name} confirmed returning '{Item Name}'. Please verify and mark as returned."
- **Type:** `loan_returned` (admin only)
- **Location:** Admin notification panel

### For User  
- **Title:** "Return Confirmation Sent"
- **Message:** "Your return confirmation for '{Item Name}' has been sent to admin. Please wait for verification."
- **Type:** `loan_returned` (user specific)
- **Location:** User notification panel

## Technical Implementation

### Files Involved
- `src/components/Loans/MyLoans.tsx` - User interface for return confirmation
- `src/contexts/DataContext.tsx` - `requestReturn()` function
- `src/services/notificationTriggers.ts` - `onReturnRequested()` notification logic
- `src/services/notificationService.ts` - Notification delivery system

### Key Functions

const requestReturn = async (loanId: string) => {
  // Update loan status
  setLoans(prev => prev.map(l => 
    l.id === loanId ? { ...l, returnRequested: true } : l
  ));
  
  // Send notifications
  await NotificationTriggers.onReturnRequested(loan, item, user);
}
```
